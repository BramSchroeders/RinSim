The simulator focuses on __simplicity__ and __consistency__ making it ideal for performing scientific simulations. Further, software quality is a priority resulting in an ever improving test suite and documentation.\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rinde/RinSim.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rinde/RinSim)\r\n\r\n<!-- ![PDPModel](docs/topbar.png) -->\r\n![Taxi Demo](docs/taxi-demo.gif)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nRinSim uses [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) for managing its dependencies. It is recommended to use the [Maven plugin for Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/). Using this plugin, RinSim can be added to your project by including the following in your pom file, where x and y represents the preferred version number. More __[detailed instructions](docs/howtorun.md)__ are available.\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n\t<groupId>com.github.rinde</groupId>\r\n\t<artifactId>rinsim-core</artifactId>\r\n\t<version>3.x.y</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\t\r\nOther modules can be added similarly:\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n\t<groupId>com.github.rinde</groupId>\r\n\t<artifactId>rinsim-ui</artifactId>\r\n\t<version>3.x.y</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n<dependency>\r\n\t<groupId>com.github.rinde</groupId>\r\n\t<artifactId>rinsim-experiment</artifactId>\r\n\t<version>3.x.y</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\t\t\r\nFor more detailed instructions on how create a Maven project in Eclipse and add RinSim as a dependency see the [instructions](docs/howtorun.md). For release notes of the latest release click [here](releasenotes.md).\r\n \r\n## Getting Started \r\nOnce the simulator is installed, you are ready to explore the simulator. It is recommended to start by running and studying the [examples](example/README.md). When using Maven in Eclipse, the RinSim JavaDocs are automatically made available making exploration of the code much easier. The remainder of this page gives a high level overview of the simulator. If you have questions or like to stay up to date about RinSim you can subscribe to the mailing list at [this page](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/rinsim).\r\n\r\n## About\r\nRinSim is developed at [AgentWise](http://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/research/taskforces/agentwise) in the [iMinds-DistriNet group](http://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/) at the [Department of Computer Science, KU Leuven, Belgium](http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/). The lead developer is [Rinde van Lon](http://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/rinde). Valuable contributions were made by Bartosz Michalik and Robrecht Haesevoets.\r\n\r\nRinSim is used in both research and education. Several publications use RinSim for their experiments and RinSim is used in a course on multi-agent systems as a testbed for students.\r\n\r\n## Open source\r\nRinSim is open source under the [Apache License Version 2.0](LICENSE).\r\nFrom version 3.0.0 RinSim uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/), this means that if you are using features introduced in version X.Y.Z it is safe to upgrade to any version greater than X.Y.Z but smaller than X+1.0.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Design Overview\r\n\r\n__Warning: description below is outdated__\r\n\r\nThis section gives a brief overview of the most important elements of the simulator. For a deeper understanding you can have a look at the examples, the source code, and the tests.\r\n\r\nIn RinSim terminology, the parts of the simulation that define the problem and environment are called models, the parts of the simulation that solve the problem (i.e. the solution, the collective adaptive system) are called agents. The design of RinSim allows for easy use and recombination of models to configure a simulation problem. When the problem is configured, the programmer can focus on solving the actual problem by designing a collective adaptive system without having to worry about accidentally violating simulation consistency. The following figure shows a high-level component diagram:\r\n\r\n![PDPModel](docs/DesignOverview.png)\r\n\r\nActions that agents can take are considered to be part of the problem not the solution, e.g. a vehicle that can pickup things or can communicate with other vehicles. Actions define the problem space in which a good solution has to be found.\r\n\r\n### Simulator\r\n\r\nThe _Simulator_ class is the heart of RinSim. Its main concern is to simulate time. This is done in a discrete manner. Time is divided in ticks of a certain length, which is chosen upon initializing the simulator (see examples and code).\r\n\r\nOf course time on its own is not so useful, so we can register objects in the simulator, such as objects implementing the _TickListener_ interface. These objects will listen to the internal clock of the simulator. You can also register other objects, as we will see in a moment.\r\n\r\nOnce started, the simulator will start to tick, and with each tick it will call all registered tickListeners, in turn, to perform some actions within the length of the time step. Time consistency is enforced by the _TimeLapse_ objects. Each _TickListener_ receives a single _TimeLapse_ object every tick, the time in this object can be 'spent' on actions. This spending can be done only once, as such an agent can not violate the time consistency in the simulator. For example, calling _RoadModel#moveTo(..)_ several times will have no effect.\r\n\r\nAs you can see there is also an _afterTick_, but we'll ignore this for now.\r\n\r\nApart from simulating time, the simulator has little functionality on its own.\r\nAll additional functionality (such as movement, communication, etc.) that is required by your simulation, should be delegated to models.\r\nThese models can be easily plugged (or registered) in the simulator.\r\n\r\n### Models\r\n\r\nOut of the box, RinSim comes with three basic models: _RoadModel_, _CommunicationModel_ and _PDPModel_. When this is not enough, it is easy to define your own custom model.\r\n\r\n* __RoadModel__: simulates a physical road structure. The _RoadModel_ allows to place and move objects (_RoadUsers_) on roads. It comes in two flavors:\r\n\t* __GraphRoadModel__: A graph based road model, objects can only move on edges of the graph. Several maps are currently available [here](http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~rinde.vanlon/rinsim/maps/).\r\n\t* __PlaneRoadModel__: A plane based road model, objects can move anywhere within the plane.\r\n* __PDPModel__: the pickup-and-delivery model. The model collaborates with the _RoadModel_, the models comes with three different _RoadUser_s: _Vehicle_, _Parcel_ and _Depot_. _Vehicles_ can transport _Parcels_ from and to _Depots_. The model enforces capacity constraints, time windows and position consistency.\r\n* __CommunicationModel__: simulates simple message-based communication between objects implementing the _CommunicationUser_ interface.\r\nIt supports both direct messaging and broadcasting.\r\nIt can also take distance, communication radius, and communication reliability into account.\r\nMessages between agents are send asynchronously.\r\n\r\n![RoadModel](docs/RoadModel.png) ![PDPModel](docs/PDPModel.png) ![CommunicationModel](docs/CommunicationModel.png)\r\n\r\n### GUI\r\n\r\nThe GUI is realized by the _SimulationViewer_, which relies on a set of _Renderers_.\r\n\r\n* __SimulationViewer__: is responsible for rendering the simulator. Specific renderers can be added for each model, for the provided models there exist default renderers.\r\n\r\n* __Renderer__: is responsible for rendering one model (or more).\r\nExamples are the _RoadUserRenderer_ to do basic rendering of objects in the _RoadModel_, or _MessagingLayerRenderer_ to visualize messages between agents.\r\nWhen introducing new models you can create new custom renderers for these models.\r\n\r\n### Simulation Entities\r\n\r\nSimulation entities are entities that are the actual objects in our simulation, such as agents, trucks, and packages.\r\nThey can implement the _TickListener_ interface and/or other interfaces to use additional models.\r\nOnce registered in the simulator, the simulator will make sure they receive ticks (if required) and are registered in all required models.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n## Git and Maven\r\nThis section assumes that you are using [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) with [m2e](http://eclipse.org/m2e/) and optionally [eGit](http://www.eclipse.org/egit/).
