RinSim is developed at [AgentWise](http://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/research/taskforces/agentwise) in the [imec-DistriNet group](http://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/) at the [Department of Computer Science, KU Leuven, Belgium](http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/). The lead developer is [Rinde van Lon](http://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/rinde). Valuable contributions were made by Bartosz Michalik and Robrecht Haesevoets.

RinSim is used in both research and education. Several publications rely on RinSim for their experiments and RinSim is used in a course on multi-agent systems as a testbed for students.
