RinSim is developed at [AgentWise](http://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/research/taskforces/agentwise) in the [imec-DistriNet group](http://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/) at the [Department of Computer Science, KU Leuven, Belgium](http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/). The lead developer is [Rinde van Lon](http://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/rinde). Valuable contributions were made by Bartosz Michalik and Robrecht Haesevoets.

RinSim is used in both research and education. Several publications rely on RinSim for their experiments and RinSim is used in a course on multi-agent systems as a testbed for students.

## How to cite RinSim

When using RinSim, academic papers should cite the following paper:

{% include cite.html authors="van Lon R.R.S., Holvoet T." title="RinSim: a simulator for collective adaptive systems in transportation and logistics" venue="Proceedings of the 6th IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO 2012)" details="pp. 231--232" year="2012" doi="10.1109/SASO.2012.41" lirias="https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/361419/1/RinSim-extended-abstract.pdf" bibtex="/pages/about/vanLon2012saso.bib" %}

When using real-time simulations, it would be appreciated if the following paper would be cited as well:

{% include cite.html authors="van Lon R.R.S., Holvoet T." title="When do agents outperform centralized algorithms?" venue="Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems" year="2017" doi="10.1007/s10458-017-9371-y" lirias="https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/585362/1/jaamas2017.pdf" bibtex="/pages/about/vanLon2017jaamas.bib" %}

For reproducibility, the RinSim version that is used should always be mentioned. To facilitate this, RinSim is being archived at Zenodo where each RinSim version has its own link and doi. See [RinSim on Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.595754).
