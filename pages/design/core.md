There are generally two main interfaces of using RinSim:

 - Simulator, a simple and direct way to interact with the simulator
 - Experiment, a more advanced interface that encapsulates Simulator, it is specifically designed for (scientific) experiments.



The core module contains the core simulation components. The core module is the entry point for getting to know the basics of RinSim. It contains the [Simulator](https://github.com/rinde/RinSim/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/github/rinde/rinsim/core/Simulator.java) class, which is the main class for configuring and controlling simulations. This module contains several packages with additional functionality.
