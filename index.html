<h2>
<a id="design-overview" class="anchor" href="#design-overview" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Design Overview</h2>

<p><strong>Warning: description below is outdated</strong></p>

<p>This section gives a brief overview of the most important elements of the simulator. For a deeper understanding you can have a look at the examples, the source code, and the tests.</p>

<p>In RinSim terminology, the parts of the simulation that define the problem and environment are called models, the parts of the simulation that solve the problem (i.e. the solution, the collective adaptive system) are called agents. The design of RinSim allows for easy use and recombination of models to configure a simulation problem. When the problem is configured, the programmer can focus on solving the actual problem by designing a collective adaptive system without having to worry about accidentally violating simulation consistency. The following figure shows a high-level component diagram:</p>

<p><img src="docs/DesignOverview.png" alt="PDPModel"></p>

<p>Actions that agents can take are considered to be part of the problem not the solution, e.g. a vehicle that can pickup things or can communicate with other vehicles. Actions define the problem space in which a good solution has to be found.</p>

<h3>
<a id="simulator" class="anchor" href="#simulator" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Simulator</h3>

<p>The <em>Simulator</em> class is the heart of RinSim. Its main concern is to simulate time. This is done in a discrete manner. Time is divided in ticks of a certain length, which is chosen upon initializing the simulator (see examples and code).</p>

<p>Of course time on its own is not so useful, so we can register objects in the simulator, such as objects implementing the <em>TickListener</em> interface. These objects will listen to the internal clock of the simulator. You can also register other objects, as we will see in a moment.</p>

<p>Once started, the simulator will start to tick, and with each tick it will call all registered tickListeners, in turn, to perform some actions within the length of the time step. Time consistency is enforced by the <em>TimeLapse</em> objects. Each <em>TickListener</em> receives a single <em>TimeLapse</em> object every tick, the time in this object can be 'spent' on actions. This spending can be done only once, as such an agent can not violate the time consistency in the simulator. For example, calling <em>RoadModel#moveTo(..)</em> several times will have no effect.</p>

<p>As you can see there is also an <em>afterTick</em>, but we'll ignore this for now.</p>

<p>Apart from simulating time, the simulator has little functionality on its own.
All additional functionality (such as movement, communication, etc.) that is required by your simulation, should be delegated to models.
These models can be easily plugged (or registered) in the simulator.</p>

<h3>
<a id="models" class="anchor" href="#models" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Models</h3>

<p>Out of the box, RinSim comes with three basic models: <em>RoadModel</em>, <em>CommunicationModel</em> and <em>PDPModel</em>. When this is not enough, it is easy to define your own custom model.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>RoadModel</strong>: simulates a physical road structure. The <em>RoadModel</em> allows to place and move objects (<em>RoadUsers</em>) on roads. It comes in two flavors:

<ul>
<li>
<strong>GraphRoadModel</strong>: A graph based road model, objects can only move on edges of the graph. Several maps are currently available <a href="http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/%7Erinde.vanlon/rinsim/maps/">here</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>PlaneRoadModel</strong>: A plane based road model, objects can move anywhere within the plane.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>PDPModel</strong>: the pickup-and-delivery model. The model collaborates with the <em>RoadModel</em>, the models comes with three different <em>RoadUser_s: _Vehicle</em>, <em>Parcel</em> and <em>Depot</em>. <em>Vehicles</em> can transport <em>Parcels</em> from and to <em>Depots</em>. The model enforces capacity constraints, time windows and position consistency.</li>
<li>
<strong>CommunicationModel</strong>: simulates simple message-based communication between objects implementing the <em>CommunicationUser</em> interface.
It supports both direct messaging and broadcasting.
It can also take distance, communication radius, and communication reliability into account.
Messages between agents are send asynchronously.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="gui" class="anchor" href="#gui" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>GUI</h3>

<p>The GUI is realized by the <em>SimulationViewer</em>, which relies on a set of <em>Renderers</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>SimulationViewer</strong>: is responsible for rendering the simulator. Specific renderers can be added for each model, for the provided models there exist default renderers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Renderer</strong>: is responsible for rendering one model (or more).
Examples are the <em>RoadUserRenderer</em> to do basic rendering of objects in the <em>RoadModel</em>, or <em>MessagingLayerRenderer</em> to visualize messages between agents.
When introducing new models you can create new custom renderers for these models.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="simulation-entities" class="anchor" href="#simulation-entities" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Simulation Entities</h3>

<p>Simulation entities are entities that are the actual objects in our simulation, such as agents, trucks, and packages.
They can implement the <em>TickListener</em> interface and/or other interfaces to use additional models.
Once registered in the simulator, the simulator will make sure they receive ticks (if required) and are registered in all required models.</p>
